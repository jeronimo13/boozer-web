						 <p>Users of this application have the opportunity to have free communication using text messages, other information and make audio and video calls. We respect the personal time and space of our users. In order to minimize the risks of communication with undesirable companions (buddies), communication in the application can occur only on condition that the desire to communicate is confirmed by both users.</p>
						<div class="listin">
							<p>6.1. Specify the status and motto of the user. Run the application. Stay in it - it is open on the screen of your mobile device, tablet or PC. Thus, you will be automatically given the status in the application, "Wanna Drink!". In the mobile version of the application, you can choose one of two statuses: "Wanna Drink!" (similar to "Online") and "Don`t Disturb" (similar to "Offline"). In the web version of the application, the statuses are given automatically, depending on whether the browser page is open now, is the status "Wanna Drink!", Or it is minimized and inactive - "Don`t Disturb". You can also express your motto (fill in a special field with text up to 180 characters), describing and expressing your desire, state of mind, emotions, expectations and the like. For example, "Wanna get drunk!", Or "Better than a beer - only a good beer!", Or "Around the world with a glass!", Or "Sorry, dudes, today`re only ladies!" Etc. This motto is important because it signals your potential companions your attitude and desire, helps companions to pick each other more clearly, accurately and correctly. As a result, such communication should be more sincere and comfortable. Your motto will be displayed everywhere in the application along with your account and login. At any time you can change both your status and your motto. Remember that the special feature and the hallmark of this application is the user's privacy.</p>
							 


							<p>6.2. "Online" button. The function of this button is to find the interlocutor by the specified parameters. You can search and select companion. To do this, you are invited to set the target parameters of the sought-for companion, according to the standard user profile data. The result of the selection is a list of several selected active users in the status "Wanna Drink!", Which appears in the application window. You can view the data of each such user, including the profile and select the person you like. If you do not want to pick any of the users from this list, you can upgrade the list of potential companions. To do this, click the Search button again, and you can change or not change the search parameters. If you have selected the companion and want to contact him, you need to click on the "Send Invitation" button - two mugs with a green plus (located at the top right of the card of the selected user). The same button is available in the expanded card of the selected user, which is opened by clicking on the avatar of that user. After you send an invitation to the addressee, he receives a notification and it has the right to accept the invitation, decline it or ignore it. If the user accepts the invitation, the sender and recipient of the invitation will automatically become friends in this application and the corresponding notification will also be sent to the sender. From this moment on, all the buttons with which you can connect with this friend become active - video call, audio call, text chat. Now you have the opportunity to contact and communicate with such a friend in any of these ways. In practice, if your desires and goals are similar, everything happens quickly and comfortably. If the addressee of the invitation has declined your request or ignored it within 24 hours, the invitation is considered canceled and the users after 24 hours go into neutral status for each other, they can again be selected by each other for communication. If your invitation has been declined or not confirmed, do not be discouraged. Most likely, there is no personal hostility, something offensive and bad, because you are not even familiar with the one who was selected. Real life is filled with different objective situations and circumstances. For example, while you sent an invitation, someone did it before you and the person is already engaged in this communication. Perhaps the person has dramatically changed plans and / or status - the chief or his wife called him. There are many people and situations are different, therefore, do not waste time, we recommend that you send an invitation in a row to 2-3 companions and someone will respond. Because you want to chat here and now and you need a positive search result, the glass is already poured ... We try to implement a tolerant, gentle and intelligent approach to the communication of users within the application!</p>
							
							<p>6.3. "Nearby" button. The application also features a search function for active users of the application who are near you, within a radius of several km. The result of the search is a similar list of users with the distance to each of them. The action algorithm here is similar to the usual search described above. A geolocation map with the display of active users on it is at the testing stage and will be launched later in the next release of the application. The main goal of the application is to connect those users who have the same goals, desires and needs.</p>
							
							<p>6.4. "Chat Roulette" button. Another interesting feature of the application is "Chat Roulette". This is the fastest way to select a buddy. By pressing this button, the system at the same moment selects for you a random interlocutor, who also pressed the chat roulette button at that moment. And at the same time directly connects you both to a video chat, without any requests, notifications and confirmations. In the video chat window on the screen of your device, anyone can appear, in this and the feature of this function. Perhaps there is a Chukchi who rode home on the deer, went into the yurt, warmed up, poured a glass and launched "The Boozer"? Or is she alone beautiful there, bored in the cabin of a cruise liner, tired of annoying drunken fans? Or maybe there is an Australian who has returned from a safari and wants to chat and share his emotions over a bottle of beer? Or is there an islander from Indonesia who wants to drink a local moonshine "Soppy" with you? Or maybe there, on the streets of the Amsterdam red-light district, a student, he came out of the Bulldog Bar, he feels good and he craves to chat with somebody? Who knows, press the "Chat Roulette" button and check for yourself who fate will give you today?))</p>
